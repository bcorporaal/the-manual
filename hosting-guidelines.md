# Hosting a UX Cocktail Hour Rotterdam meetup event
This is a short overview of how to organize a UX Cocktail Hour meetup. No worries, it is nothing fancy.


## The concept
The UX Cocktail Hour Rotterdam is an informal event for everyone who has an interest in User Experience Design. The first UX Cocktail Hour started in 2001 in Amsterdam and is organized by Peter Boersma. In 2011 the event found its way to Rotterdam.

The Rotterdam edition is organized by **[Bob Corporaal](https://reefscape.net)**.

Each event is at a different location in or close to Rotterdam. Most often at a company or organization that works in the field of UX. The goal is to educate and inspire the UX community by sharing knowledge and networking. Part of this is catching a peek behind the scenes of a company but also meeting other people in the field. In addition we have speakers and workshops on different topics related to User Experience. This can be design, research, projects, education, technology, development or any combination. Of course there is ample opportunity to enjoy a drink and chat.

We organize about 3 to 4 events a year. Currently we have about 1300 members in the community ranging from designers, developers to ux researchers.


## Hosting a meetup
If you want to organize a UX Cocktail Hour just **[get in touch](mailto://bob@reefscape.net)**. As you can read below it is not very complex. We just need a place, some drinks and a presentation. It is a great way to share your knowledge, get to know new people and be inspired by the audience.


## General event outline
Each event follows this general planning. It is flexible but keep in mind that most attendees have just finished an eight hour work day. So keep the evening compact and leave room for drinks and networking at the end. Around 22.00 you will find that (some) people will want to go home.

### Example program
Feel free to adjust as needed.

## Topic and presentations
Just about anything related to UX Design can be a topic for the UX Cocktail Hour. Have a look at [previous events](/previous-events.md) to see what kind of topics have already been covered.

When picking a topic start with the knowledge and experience of your organization. There is probably something you have a special interest in or experience with. This can be something as simple as a new design method or as big as a new view on the future of UX.

Keep in mind though that you are talking to experienced colleagues. No need to explain what UX is or how beneficial it is to think about the user. Also presentations that just show a portolio or a collection of 'cool' projects don't get high scores. So dig deeper than that. Think about what you would find an interesting talk at a conference. Share something that your would want to learn and present it as if you would present it to a colleague. So, just as if this was a meetupâ€¦

From experience the audience is particularly interested in things they can apply 'the next day'. That and funny stories of spectacular failures.

You can also consider the option to bring in an external speaker. Perhaps you have a client or somebody you know who is an expert on a particular topic. If you are looking for options we can help as well.


## Workshops
Organizing a small workshop related to the topic is a nice addition too. It makes for a more dynamic evening and allows the attendees to apply what they just learned. Just keep it simple and don't expect the results to be too serious. Also keep in mind what to do with the results. Having each team present their concepts will take a long time. On the other hand not presenting them can also be a bit of a let down. So you need to find a balance between the two.


## Attendees
The number of attendees to be invited mostly depends on the available space. In general we have between 40 and 70 people. Don't forget to invite your own employees, network and perhaps customers. They are welcome too of course. Because there is always a number of no-shows we allow for a few more spots on the RSVP list.

All the RSVP's are handled through the meetup.com page. We can provide an up to date list of attendees before the event. E-mail addresses of the attendees are not available for the host.


## Logo materials
In the **[identity directory](identity)** of this repository you can find the UX Cocktail Hour logo in various formats. You can use this on signage, blog posts or whatever you can come up with.


## To-do list
See the full event checklist [event checklist](/event-checklist.md) for some things to put on your to-do list when organizing a meetup.

## Presentation tips

**What works well**
- Share your expertise.
- Make it practical.
- Have fun but don't let it get in the way of sharing knowledge.
- Don't pretend everything goes perfect in your projects. Be honest and share your failures.

**What doesn't work so well**
- Talking too much about your own company.
- Explaining what UX is or similar things that everybody already knows.
- Unprepared presentations.
- Loooooooong presentations.

## General tips

- Leave plenty of room in your schedule. Things always start later and take longer than planned.
