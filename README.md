# The UX Cocktail Hour Rotterdam
This repository is for anything related to organizing the [UX Cocktail Hour Rotterdam](https://www.meetup.com/Rotterdam-UX-Cocktail-Hours/) meetups.

## About this meetup
The UX Cocktail Hour Rotterdam is an informal event for everyone who has an interest in User Experience. It was founded in 2001 in Amsterdam by Peter Boersma and  found its way to Rotterdam in 2011. We have speakers and workshops on topics related to UX: design, research, projects, education and development. There is ample opportunity to enjoy a drink and chat. There are about 4 events a year. Each edition is at a different location in or nearby Rotterdam.

Currently we have about 1300 members in the community ranging from designers, developers to ux researchers.
